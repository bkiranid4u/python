"""Euler 005 -
    Problem:
        The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

pow(1,2) + pow(2,2) + ... + pow(10,2) = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

pow((1 + 2 + ... + 10),2) = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
